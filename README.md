Magic Squares calculator on Go

This is my training project on Go, the algorithm uses the possibilities of productive and multi-flow recursive calculation of rearrangements of the source figures of the source array.

This is a light version (without BigInt), and it does not support squares with a dimension of more than 7

Symmetric checks for:
-horizontals
-verticals
-diagonals

Using:
-Set in the source file the dimension of the calculated square
-Run it
