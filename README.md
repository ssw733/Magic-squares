Magic Squares calculator on Go

This is my training project on Go, the algorithm uses the possibilities of productive and multi-flow recursive calculation of rearrangements of the source figures of the source array.

This is a light version (without BigInt), and it does not support squares with a dimension of more than 7

Symmetric checks for:<br/>
-horizontals<br/>
-verticals<br/>
-diagonals

Using:<br/>
-Set in the source file the dimension of the calculated square<br/>
-Run it
